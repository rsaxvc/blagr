<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">So, for the past few days, my computer has been acting very strangely. It often locked up or rebooted all by itself. Today I finally learned what had caused it. I happen to own of the earlier <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor" title="Multi-core processor" rel="wikipedia">dual-core processors</a>, a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_D" title="Pentium D" rel="wikipedia">Pentium D</a> with <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading" title="Hyper-threading" rel="wikipedia">hyperthreading</a>. Running <a class="zem_slink" href="http://htop.sourceforge.net/" title="Htop (Unix)" rel="homepage">HTOP</a>, I could see only 2 processors, where there should be four. Usually, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit" title="Central processing unit" rel="wikipedia">CPUs</a> in linux count first the real cores, then the virtual cores. In my computer, Cores 0 and 2 were the only ones running. I feared a corrupted bios had turned off my second core, but alas, Core 1 is dead. I'm quite happy with the fail-state though. Once the core completely died, my computer is running fine...well, half as fast as it used to, but it's still pretty good.</span>
